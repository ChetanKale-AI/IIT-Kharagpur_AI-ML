# AI/ML Coursework Repository  

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and other resources developed during my hands-on learning and practical experience in AI/ML as part of the **IIT Kharagpur coursework**. The repository is organized to cover a wide range of topics and applications in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Repository Overview  

### Topics Covered  
1. **AI in Leadership**  
   - Insights into leveraging AI for strategic decision-making and leadership applications.
  
2. **Advanced Deep Learning (DL)**  
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
     - Techniques using BERT, Transformers, and other state-of-the-art NLP models.  

3. **DL Applications in Computer Vision (CV)**  
   - Implementation of deep learning algorithms for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

4. **Deep Learning Fundamentals**  
   - Core concepts and foundational architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and GANs.

5. **Mathematical Fundamentals for AI/ML**  
   - Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization techniques for understanding ML and DL models.

6. **Programming Assignments**
